# Activity

Reproduce the following plot:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="figure01.svg" width = 600></object>

### Indications:

* `theme_classic()` was used as starting point.
* For each car (combination of manufacturer and model) the average of `hwy` variables was calculated.
* Useful functions: 
    * `str_to_title` from `stringr` package.
    * `fct_reorder` from `forcats` package.
